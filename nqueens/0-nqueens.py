N-Queens Solver

This script solves the N-Queens problem, which is the challenge of placing N queens 
on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Usage:
    - N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4.
    - The program prints all possible solutions, one per line, in the format:
      [[row1, col1], [row2, col2], ..., [rowN, colN]]

Functions:
    print_solution(solution): Prints a solution in the required format.
    is_safe(solution, row, col): Checks if placing a queen at (row, col) is safe.
    solve_nqueens(N, row, solution, solutions): Uses backtracking to solve the problem.
    nqueens(): Main function to handle input and solve the problem.

    Example:
        If solution = [1, 3, 0, 2], it prints:
